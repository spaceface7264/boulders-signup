# UX Canvas Generated Project

This React + TypeScript + Vite project was generated by UX Canvas AI Designer.

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

## Project Structure

```
src/
├── components/     # Reusable UI components
├── screens/        # Application screens/pages
├── App.tsx         # Main application component
└── main.tsx        # Application entry point
```

## How It Works

- **Screens**: Navigate between screens using `?screen=ScreenName` in the URL
- **Components**: Reusable UI components used throughout the application

## Screen Navigation

Visit different screens by adding the screen name as a query parameter:
- `http://localhost:5173/?screen=HomePage`
- `http://localhost:5173/?screen=ProfilePage`
- `http://localhost:5173/` (shows screen list when no screen specified)

## Tech Stack

- **React 18** - UI framework
- **TypeScript** - Type safety
- **Vite** - Build tool and dev server
- **Tailwind CSS** - Styling
- **ESLint** - Code linting
