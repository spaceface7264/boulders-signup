# Boulders Signup Frontend

> **Note for Backend Developers:**
>
> This repository contains the **frontend design and implementation only** for the Boulders signup and membership system. All UI/UX, flows, and components are built in React (Vite) and Tailwind CSS. There is no backend/API logic implemented here—data is currently mocked or managed in React context.
>
> **Your tasks:**
> - Review the UI and flows to understand what endpoints and data models are needed.
> - Integrate backend APIs where marked (see code comments and TODOs).
> - Use the Style Guide (`src/screens/StyleGuide.tsx`) to see all components and states.

## Getting Started (Frontend Only)

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
2. **Run the app locally:**
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
3. **Open in browser:**
   Visit [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) (or the port shown in your terminal).

## Project Structure

- `src/screens/` — Main app screens (signup flow, profile, confirmation, etc.)
- `src/components/` — Shared UI components (header, progress bar, etc.)
- `src/utils/FormContext.tsx` — Global form state (mocked, replace with API calls as needed)
- `src/screens/StyleGuide.tsx` — **Component gallery** for all UI elements

---

## Where to Integrate Backend APIs

- Look for `// TODO: Call backend API here` comments in the code.
- Replace mock data and context updates with real API calls.
- Data models (user, membership, punch card, etc.) are defined in `FormContext.tsx`.
- All forms and flows are ready to connect to backend endpoints.

# UX Canvas Generated Project

This React + TypeScript + Vite project was generated by UX Canvas AI Designer.

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

## Project Structure

```
src/
├── components/     # Reusable UI components
├── screens/        # Application screens/pages
├── App.tsx         # Main application component
└── main.tsx        # Application entry point
```

## How It Works

- **Screens**: Navigate between screens using `?screen=ScreenName` in the URL
- **Components**: Reusable UI components used throughout the application

## Screen Navigation

Visit different screens by adding the screen name as a query parameter:
- `http://localhost:5173/?screen=HomePage`
- `http://localhost:5173/?screen=ProfilePage`
- `http://localhost:5173/` (shows screen list when no screen specified)

## Tech Stack

- **React 18** - UI framework
- **TypeScript** - Type safety
- **Vite** - Build tool and dev server
- **Tailwind CSS** - Styling
- **ESLint** - Code linting
